# Terminal Velocity

## Please see the branch tv_python3 for the new version

Terminal Velocity is currently in maintenance mode. Python pip installs are 
still supported and the software is stable for day to day use with python 2.
The software is being moved into maintenance mode because both authors 
no longer use terminal_velocity. Life happens and finding the time to maintain 
it is difficult. We hope you understand.

Terminal Velocity is a fast note-taking app for the UNIX terminal, that
focuses on letting you create or find a note as quickly and easily as
possible, then uses your `$EDITOR` to open and edit the note. It is
heavily inspired by the OS X app [Notational
Velocity](http://notational.net/). For screenshots and features, see the
[Terminal Velocity website](https://github.com/vhp/terminal_velocity).
